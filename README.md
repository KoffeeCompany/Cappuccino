# Cappuccino - Olympus Hackathon

This is the documentation and read me for the Ohmptions by Koffee Team.
This project was done during the Olympus Hackathon December 2021

## OHMPTIONS

## Overview

The aim of Cappuccino is to allow users to create complex options strategies using Olympus bond to hedge their position against both upward and downward moves.

A call option is bought when the investor expects the underlying value will rise before the expiry date. As the same of the traditional finance option which represents the right, but not the obligation, to take exercise at the maturity

Just like you would not compare an option expected value to the underlying, you should not compare being an LP to holding the underlying. They have different risk profiles. 

Visualizing LP'ing in a framework of options can help with this.

### Overview
Trading UniV3 Options allows you to simulate a call or put payoff by using a single tick range order
A strangle can be emulated by using multiple ticks, note as you increase the ticks you provide over your payoff begins to curve
This might be the most liquid place to trade with option like payoffs for any given token pair
You can settle your options in any any token pair (not just an ETH put denominated in USDC, but could be in any token)
Knowing when to withdraw your liquidity can be hard, if above your tick you might loose a little to impermanent loss (you can think of this as your option being exercised). Best case is probably price rises/below your call/put so that you capture the fees (your premium) and then reverts back below.

### Premium
Premium is not paid up front, but accrued over time in fees.

*Note: you have to consider the time value of money here, as you only earn fees **once** the spot price crosses over your single tick range (capturing the entire fee rate once it does, ie 0.3%)*

- Ideally the spot price crosses over your tick and then back below, in this case you will capture fees twice.

### Expiration
- Functions like a perpetual option (there is no expiry, you must withdraw your liquidity)
### Payoff
- A single tick range order has the exact payoff of a covered call option
- A multiple tick range order has a curved payoff chart
